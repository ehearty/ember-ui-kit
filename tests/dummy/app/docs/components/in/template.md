# `in`

`in` components are input components that are meant to collect user inputs. Following
DDAU principle, they typically fire actions up to let controllers to handle any value
changes.

`in` components broadly boils down to just 3 main types: text, toggle, and select.
UI Kit offers the base class of these 3 categories of components and you are free
to extend them.
